## 👋 Who Am I?

Hi! I'm **Aritra**, an Electronics & Communication Engineering student who enjoys building things at the intersection of **hardware and software**. I work across **web development, embedded systems, and AI/ML**—using whatever tool gets the job done instead of forcing a stack.

I code mainly in **C, Python, and React.js**, and I’ve built everything from **web apps and dashboards** to a **Bluetooth RC car** and **ML-based prediction projects**.

Right now, I’m focused on sharpening my **frontend skills** while going deeper into **electronics**, instead of staying surface-level. I’m actively learning **machine learning** and **data structures**, and I care a lot about understanding *why* things work—not just making them work.

I’m always open to collaborating on **open-source IoT** or **AI/ML projects with real social impact**. If you’re into **embedded systems, edge ML, or squeezing performance out of limited hardware**, we’ll probably get along.

⚡ **Fair warning:** when something genuinely interests me, I tend to hyper-focus and go all in.
